# Digit_Classification_using_CNN
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow, leveraging the power of deep learning for image recognition tasks.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including reshaping and min-max scaling, to optimize model training.
- **CNN Architecture:** A carefully designed CNN architecture is employed, incorporating convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract features and perform classification.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance. Accuracy and loss metrics are used to gauge the model's effectiveness.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib is used to visualize the handwritten digits and display the model's predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The **MNIST dataset** consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9):

- **Training Set:** 60,000 images
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images

Each image is a 28x28 pixel matrix, with each pixel representing grayscale intensity.
